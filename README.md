# Project Goal

The goal of the project is to develop a game library with two key features:

1. A **ranking system**
2. An **alphabetic storage mechanism**  

The primary objective is to enhance user experience and satisfaction by providing a platform that not only organizes games alphabetically but also incorporates a ranking system.  

The ranking system aims to improve user happiness by offering a curated list of games based on their:

- Popularity
- User ratings   
- Other relevant metrics

This combination of features is designed to create a user-friendly and enjoyable gaming experience within the library.
  
# Implementation  

The project will leverage advanced algorithms to efficiently implement the desired features.

For the alphabetic storage, a **Quick Sort algorithm** will be employed. Quick Sort is a fast and efficient sorting algorithm, making it ideal for organizing the game library alphabetically. This choice ensures that users can easily locate and access their desired games in an optimized manner.

Additionally, for the ranking system, a **Binary Search Tree (BST) algorithm** will be implemented. A Binary Search Tree is well-suited for maintaining a dynamic ranking system, where games can be efficiently inserted, deleted, and searched based on their ranking criteria. This approach allows for a streamlined and responsive ranking system that adapts well to changes in game popularity or user preferences.   

By incorporating these advanced algorithms, the project aims to not only provide a seamless and intuitive user experience but also to optimize the performance of both the alphabetic storage and ranking system components within the game library.
