# Project Goal

The goal of the project is to develop a game library with two key features:

1. A **ranking system**
2. An **alphabetic storage mechanism**  

The primary objective is to enhance user experience and satisfaction by providing a platform that not only organizes games alphabetically but also incorporates a ranking system.  

The ranking system aims to improve user happiness by offering a curated list of games based on their:

- Popularity
- User ratings   
- Other relevant metrics

This combination of features is designed to create a user-friendly and enjoyable gaming experience within the library.
  
# Implementation  

The project will leverage advanced algorithms to efficiently implement the desired features.

For the alphabetic storage, a **Quick Sort algorithm** will be employed. Quick Sort is a fast and efficient sorting algorithm, making it ideal for organizing the game library alphabetically. This choice ensures that users can easily locate and access their desired games in an optimized manner.

Additionally, for the ranking system, a **Binary Search Tree (BST) algorithm** will be implemented. A Binary Search Tree is well-suited for maintaining a dynamic ranking system, where games can be efficiently inserted, deleted, and searched based on their ranking criteria. This approach allows for a streamlined and responsive ranking system that adapts well to changes in game popularity or user preferences.   

By incorporating these advanced algorithms, the project aims to not only provide a seamless and intuitive user experience but also to optimize the performance of both the alphabetic storage and ranking system components within the game library.

# Significance

The project holds significance in enhancing happiness and user satisfaction within the gaming community. By implementing a game library with a ranking system and alphabetic storage, the project addresses key aspects that contribute to the overall well-being and enjoyment of users.

**Improved User Experience:**

- The alphabetic storage ensures that users can easily and quickly find their favorite games, reducing frustration and enhancing the overall user experience. This streamlined organization promotes a user-friendly interface, contributing to a positive and efficient interaction with the game library.

**Curated Ranking System:**  

- The ranking system adds a layer of curation to the gaming experience. By incorporating a Binary Search Tree algorithm, the project ensures that games are dynamically ranked based on popularity, user ratings, or other relevant metrics. This curated approach helps users discover high-quality games, fostering a sense of satisfaction and engagement.  

**Community Engagement:**

- The ranking system encourages community engagement as users can see what games are trending or highly rated by their peers. This social aspect enhances the sense of belonging within the gaming community, providing users with a platform to share experiences, recommendations, and preferences.

**Time Efficiency:**  

- The Quick Sort algorithm for alphabetic storage significantly reduces the time it takes for users to locate specific games. This efficiency is crucial in today's fast-paced digital environment, where users value quick and convenient access to their desired content, contributing to a stress-free and enjoyable gaming experience.

**Positive Impact on Mental Well-being:**  

- A well-organized and curated game library contributes to the mental well-being of users by reducing the cognitive load associated with searching for games. The project aims to create an environment that promotes relaxation, entertainment, and happiness, recognizing the importance of digital experiences in influencing overall mood and mental health.
  
In summary, the project's significance lies in its ability to enhance happiness and user satisfaction by providing an organized, curated, and efficient gaming library experience. This positively impacts the well-being of individuals within the gaming community, contributing to a safer and more enjoyable digital space.
